PRACTICAL WORK: RADIO STATION WEBSITE

This website was created as part of the online course "Frontend Developer PRO", which I took on the basis of the online professional education platform Skillbox to improve my skills and structure my knowledge.

It was the final work of the module "Web Development: Basic Level". Problem statement: to build a fully valid adaptive and cross-browser working website on a ready-made graphic template ([link](https://www.figma.com/file/4Zu9n2KcjiesKJb6HBix3z/W-Wave-Radio-(new)?node-id=0-1&t=W5aoTxiiVNidGb0U-0) + UI/UX elements), applying the theoretical material of the course module in practice + PerfectPixel.
